# Trending-Youtube-Video-Statistics
I did these as my academic project for Data Visualization course using JavaScript, D3.js, HTML, CSS.

Gives all the analysis about trending YouTube video statistics: highest views based on the category and likes and dislikes of Top 20 videos and number of days it took for a video to get trending from the day its posted.

It helps users to get information about which category related videos are on trending, number of days it's taking for particular video to get trending for example videos based on studies may take long time to get famous but videos of some popular stars or music videos will get trended with in few days or over night. It gives all such analysis so that YouTubers can decide on which category to make their videos.
